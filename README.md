# How-Much-Yarn
This Project Aims to Create a GUI to figure out how much of each color yarn is needed for a crochet project. This helps with pattern creation and also with how much you need to buy.

This project has the user make a guage swatch and weigh it. This gives the unique ability to be used regardless of project, hook/needle size, or whether one is doing Crochet, Tunisian Crochet, or even Knitting.

Currently it focuses on taking in data points and telling the user how much yarn is needed for this project. Which will be given in both exact grams and approximate # of skeins.
